Operations:

enqueue(order) → Add new order to the rear

dequeue() → Process (remove) the front order when ready

isFull() → Check if queue has reached maximum capacity

isEmpty() → Check if no orders are pending

display() → Show all current orders

To prevent overflow/underflow:

Use a circular queue so that space is reused efficiently.

Always check isFull() and isEmpty() before enqueue/dequeue.

To print processed orders:

Store processed orders in another list or log them as they’re dequeued,
then print them in the same order they were received.
